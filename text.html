       <b>       Build: </b>
                It is so simple that according to your options and selections, the CSS will be changed for them to be look like a Word file.

        <b>      Advantages :</b>
                No need to rush to the MS Word for smaller tasks. 
                Simply Go, Write and Save !
                Infact, we have created the Abstract of this project using this Editor.<br><br>

            <b>Disadvantages:</b>  
                Same thing in Code Editor that this is a virtual editor so you have to download them to store in your local storage.
