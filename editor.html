<div id="abstract">Live Code Editor :</div>
<div class="Intro2">
              This is a Live Code Editor which is useful for the Students interested in Designing Web Pages in HTML, CSS ans JS.<br> It is so frustrating to Write, Save and then Open browser and Refresh Rinse-Repeatedly. So, i have a solution for this in this Editor.
<br><br>

            <div id="cent">
                <img class="imgg" src="liveeditor.jfif">
            </div>
            <br><br>
             <b> Build: </b>
                The frontend is designed by React Js and the Themes, Syntax, Auto-Closing Brackets, Colors are imported from the Codemirror Library individually HTML, CSS, JS and their Syntax. 
        <br>        
                Here, I've used panda-syntax [ for dark mode ] and mdn-like [ for light mode ].
<br>
                The Code mirror engine will take care of the live update of the code and preview them in live time.

<br>
   <br>      <b> Advantages:</b>    
                No more Installation of VS Code Live Server Extensions, Auto Save features and N number of times save and refreshes. Simply type the code , there your webpage is being made at live time !
<br><br>
       <b>Disadvantages:</b>       
                You have to download those codes to save them in your local storage because, we are using a virtual Engine for Preview and you will have the download button in the same component.
