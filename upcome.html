    <div class="Intro2">

            
<br>
          <b>      1. Calendar with To-Do list and Alarm :</b>
     <br><br>           
                    The Calendar in which we can set our important dates or any other Tasks you are going to do and set an Alarm for that by enabling Music or Notification or both for the Reminder.
<br><br>
            <b>    2. Mail Service :</b>
<br><br>
                    The in-built Mail Service will enable you to send emails on-the-go from our application. No more sign-in to GMail and those Slowness.
<br>
                    Just send and receive the Sent Message for Simple emails. Infact, it is possible to send mail by type preceeded with "" @mail "" . That's it !
<br><br>
                <b>3. In-Built Chat Application : </b>
<br><br>
                    This is an useful service for all of the People who are using this. By the chat application, you can send Messages to different Users using this application and receive texts from them.
<br><br>
                    No more Whatsapp for Texts. Don't worry I'm using some Encryptors and Decryptors for the message passing and the Database is also in the MongoDB Cluster's Cloud. So, it is safe enough !
<br>
                And some of the other features, Translator Tool and Local Weather Monitor.
<br><br>
          <b>      Building and Application Creation : </b>
<br><br>
                    As we build by Vite Library, it helps us to Build this into an Installable MSI File easily.
                    By using Tauri, a tool for application building, we will create an installable application.
<br>
                    For Mobiles, I will create an exact project of React Native and create the MATE Mobile Application.
